I use a **Harry Potter Fanfiction dataset** from Kaggle to practice data analysis. I **explore** the data in a python notebook with Pandas, **clean** the data (deleting certain columns, splitting certain columns, removing specific column categories).

I then **analyze** this data and **create visuals** to go wiht my analysis!

This was a fun student project to get familiar with data cleaning and analysis tools with Python.
