I use a **Harry Potter Fanfiction dataset** from Kaggle to practice data analysis. This dataset includes info about all fan written harry potter stories uploaded to the site fanfic.net from 2001-2019.  

I **explore** the data in a python notebook with Pandas, **clean** the data. I then **analyze** this data and **create visuals** to go with my analysis!

This was a fun student project to get familiar with data cleaning and analysis tools with Python.

Install the requirements.txt to pip install pandas, numpy and Python. 

The harry.ipynb can be opened and read to see where I explored my raw data. I made choices in this exploration about what cleaning functions would be needed.

My cleanharry.py file contains my cleaning scripts where I delete certain columns, split certain columns, remove null values, and remove specific column categories.
