I use a **Harry Potter Fanfiction dataset** from Kaggle to practice data analysis. This dataset includes info about all fan written harry potter stories uploaded to the site fanfic.net from 2001-2019.  

I **explore** this data in a jupyter notebook with Pandas, and then **clean** the data. I then **analyze** this data and **create visuals** to go with my analysis!

<h3>Summary</h3>

This was a fun student project to get familiar with data cleaning and analysis tools with Python.

- Install the **requirements.txt** to get specific *package install requirements* to pip install pandas, numpy and specific Python version. 

- The **explore_harry.ipynb** can be opened and read to see where I *explored my raw data*. I made choices in this exploration about what cleaning functions would be needed.

- My **cleanharry.py** file contains my *cleaning scripts* where I delete certain columns, split certain columns, remove null values, reformat, and remove specific column categories. 

- The **analyze_harry.ipynb** can be opened and read to see where I further analyzed my clean data and made plots using matplotlib.

<h3>Project Requirements Included</h3>

- Pandas **read_csv** function to read in the CSV file

- **Cleaned data** using built-in pandas and numpy functions to remove 0â€™s and null values, split an existing date column into two columns (for month and year), removed unwanted columns(Last Updated, story links, language, and original mm-yr columns), removed unwanted categories from columns (languages other than english), changed Month Published column from listing months as numbers to listing months as names, and saved all changes to a new clean data csv.

- **Some Pandas functions** used in both jupyter notebooks
   
     .head(), .columns, .shape, .info(), .isnull().sum().sort_values(ascending=False), .unique(), .value_counts(), .describe(), .groupby, print, int(), .iloc

- Made **basic plots with matplotlib**

   .plot(kind='bar'), plt.scatter, ax.pie

- Wrote **markdown in Jupyter Notebooks** explaining process in between all lines of code
