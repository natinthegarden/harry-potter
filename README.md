I use a **Harry Potter Fanfiction dataset** from Kaggle to practice data analysis. This dataset includes info about all fan written harry potter stories uploaded to the site fanfic.net from 2001-2019.  
---
I **explore** this data in a python notebook with Pandas, and then **clean** the data. I then **analyze** this data and **create visuals** to go with my analysis!

This was a fun student project to get familiar with data cleaning and analysis tools with Python.

- Install the **requirements.txt** to pip install pandas, numpy and Python. 

- The **explore_harry.ipynb** can be opened and read to see where I explored my raw data. I made choices in this exploration about what cleaning functions would be needed.

- My **cleanharry.py** file contains my cleaning scripts where I delete certain columns, split certain columns, remove null values, and remove specific column categories.
